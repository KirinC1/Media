        <p>I think that the thing that impacted me the most in a positive way was videos on YouTube. More specifically,
        videos on the game Mario Kart Wii.<br><br>When I was growing up, I played a lot of Mario Kart, I loved the game. And eventually, I got competitive. I started to watch
     videos on the game, including videos on shortcuts, tips, and competitive races.</p>

        <p>After a while, I was inspired to make my own content on the game. At that age,
            I felt like I was actually part of a community that was great and fun to be in. <br>I think that the fact that I was
            able to make friends in this community that I would still have to this day is amazing.
